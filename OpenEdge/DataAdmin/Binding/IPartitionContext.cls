    Purpose     : Interface needed by all Partioncontext classes including query
    Syntax      : 
    Description : 
    Author(s)   : hdaniels
    Created     : Mon Nov 01 2010
    Notes       : There are realize methods in IPartitionCollection implementations that
                  use this interface to find the TT. (collection Find returns the class) 
                  The iterator:next relies on these to realize the class. 
                   (could be better ways to sync iterator?)   
                - Collections should ideally call the query context with simpler 
                  interfaces. (except area:partitions)
