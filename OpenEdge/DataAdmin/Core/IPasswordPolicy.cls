    File        : IPasswordPolicy
    Purpose     : defines password rules currently used by user and domain
    Syntax      :  
    Description : 
    Author(s)   : hdaniels
    Created     : Wed Oct 29 2014
    Notes       : Defined as separate interface in case we want more 
                  rules.(a simple case would be password length) 
               -  Exposed through DataAdminService:PasswordPolicy,
                  which have a default implementation.  
               -  The DataAdminService:PasswordPolicy property is settable 
                  so one could add a class that implements this, but keep in
                  mind that this interface is likely to change in future 
                  versions
