    File        : IFilterEvents
    Purpose     : Indicates that a filter publishes events, and provides a method
                  for doing so.

    Notes       : * Ideally the SubscribeListener() method would take a generic
                    parameter so that we could guarantee type-compliance at the
                    compiler. But we have to do it at runtime instead.
                  * The Filter will describe the events and the FilterEventListenerType
                    the handlers. Clearly these need to be in sync with each other,
                    otherwise we can end up with listeners that are never published 
                    to, and events that have no listeners.
