    Purpose     : resolve relative path of full path file
                  prompts if relative name shadowed by other file in propath
    Syntax      :
     
    Description : 

    Author(s)   : 
    Created     : Apr 2013
    Notes       : No check for valid-file. 
                  will return passed file if invalid
                  will return relative filename if path matches propath even if file does not exist
    Parameter      input-output filename
                   in - full pathed file 
                   out - relative path if in propath (and confirmed if shadowed) 
                          
                       - "" if cancel shadowed selection 
                       - fullpath in all other cases (no check for valid file)
