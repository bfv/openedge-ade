    Notes       : * See the ABL Help and/or documentation for details 
                  * This program based on the AutoEdge|TheFactory version
                  * The Sax-Write-* versions are added since the underlying
                    values were always those, and the name shortened. Built-in
                    enums don't allow you to set these independently
